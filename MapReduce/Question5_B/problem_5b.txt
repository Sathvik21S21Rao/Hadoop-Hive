Follow these instructions to run code for Problem 5B. The compilation was done using Maven on the IntelliJ IDE. Relevant files for compilation (specifically, pom.xml and the output of 5A which was used as output for this, named "part-r-00000-sorted") have been included in the submission.

Recreate project hierarchy:

Problem_5B
   src
      main
         java
            org
               nosql
                  TFIDF.java (included in submission)
                  openllp-tools-1.9.3.jar
    
   pom.xml (included in submission)


run "maven clean install", and the .jar is created in a new "target" folder, in the project directory. Although 2 jars are created, one must run "TFIDF-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar".

To first upload the necessary files:

hdfs dfs -put part-r-00000-sorted /


It is to be run on the hadoop file system as follows:

hadoop jar TFIDF-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar /input_dir /output_dir hdfs://localhost:9000/part-r-00000-sorted
