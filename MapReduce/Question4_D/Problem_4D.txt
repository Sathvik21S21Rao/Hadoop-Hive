To compile and execute:

Javac -classpath <classpath> -d <output_directory> <javafile>.java
Jar -cvf <jar_file_name> -C <class files directory> .

To run the jar file:

time hadoop jar PairsAggregation.jar PairsAggregation /B_input "/4d_output_pairs/" /4d_input/top_freq_4a $dist $agg
time hadoop jar StripesAggregation.jar StripesAggregation /B_input "/4d_output_stripes/" /4d_input/top_freq_4a $dist $agg


To execute for all values of dist and agg, this was done using an executable shell command file for pairs and stripes, attached in the submission.

Screenshots of the output are named as {dist}_{agg}.png
