Recreate project hierarchy:

Problem_5A
   src
      main
         java
            org
               nosql
                  Main.java (included in submission)
                  openllp-tools-1.9.3.jar
         resources
            org
               nosql
                  stopwords.txt
    
   pom.xml (included in submission)


run "maven clean install", and the .jar is created in a new "target" folder, in the project directory. Although 2 jars are created, one must run "NoSQL_assn2_B-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar".


It is to be run on the hadoop file system as follows:

hadoop jar NoSQL_assn2_B-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.nosql.Main /input_dir /output_dir


To sort the output and retain the first 100 records, run "retain.py"
